This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to identify anomalies in transaction patterns and minimize false positives while ensuring maximum accuracy in fraud detection.

Features
Handles imbalanced dataset using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.

Implements data preprocessing (scaling, normalization).

Models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.

Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.

Supports real-time prediction (optional).
